# A brief introduction to the tidyverse

_Created for use in NYU Abu Dhabi's Data Analysis course (POLSC-AD 209)_

## What?
The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a set of R packages designed to streamline common data science procedures. The objects, methods, and functions created in these packages follow the philosophy of ["tidy data"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html). Packages range in application from reading and scraping to merging, modeling, and plotting.

## Why?
Using tidyverse packages makes life easier. Functions in the tidyverse are designed to be picked up quickly. Implementing these functions can often make code faster, clearer to read, and easier to write.

To learn more about the tidyverse, check out the lessons and exercises in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
