# A brief introduction to the tidyverse

_Created for use in NYU Abu Dhabi's Data Analysis course (POLSC-AD 209)_

## What?
The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a set of R packages designed to streamline common data science procedures. The objects, methods, and functions created in these packages follow the philosophy of ["tidy data"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html). Packages range in application from reading and scraping to merging, modeling, and plotting.

## Why?
Using tidyverse packages makes life easier. Functions in the tidyverse are designed for you to learn quickly. Implementing these functions can often make code faster, clearer to read, and easier to write.

To learn more about the tidyverse, check out the lessons and exercises in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).

## Lessons
These materials are designed to supplement an introductory Data Analysis course taught in NYU Abu Dhabi's political science program. They assume a basic understanding of R and some familiarity with its data structures, particularly data frames. To follow along with these lessons, clone or download the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coletl/tidy_intro) and open `tidy_intro.Rproj` in RStudio. You'll be able to view a lesson by opening an `.nb.html` file in any web browser, and you can run the code in its corresponding `.Rmd` file.

If you'd just like to read through the lessons, you can follow the links here:

## Contributions
All suggestions and contributions are welcome. I am trying to orient the examples toward political science, but I'm happy to host demonstrations and data (smaller than 100MB) for other lessons in applying the tidyverse to problems in any of the social sciences.
